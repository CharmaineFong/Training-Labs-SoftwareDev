## Branch protection rules
Branch protection rules allow us to enforce workflows to prevent unwelcome things happening on our repositories. For example, we may wish to have make sure that any code entering the main branch has been approved as part of a pull request, that all our tests are passing, or that our code meets style guidelines. In basic terms, we are trying to ensure our code is of a high quality by automatically enforcing the rules so we don't forget.


## Preventing direct push to main
A basic rule which is often used is preventing direct pushes to the main branch. This is done by enforcing pull requests. To set this up on your repo:

1. Under your repository name in GitHub, click Settings
2. In the "Code and automation" section of the sidebar, click  Branches.
3. Next to "Branch protection rules", click Add rule.
4. Under "Branch name pattern", type "main"
5. Under "Protect matching branches", select Require a pull request before merging.
6. Set "Require Approvals" to be 1.
7. Set "Do not allow bypassing the above settings" to 1.


To test this, attempt to push a change directly to main. It should be blocked.

## Adding github actions to run the tests
GitHub Actions allow users to create custom workflows hooked into your GitHub repos. This is really useful for CI/CD type activities, such as running test suites or building code.


To demonstrate the capabilities of GitHub actions, we are going to create a scenario where we ensure tests are passing before merging into the main branch:

1. Create a new branch for the changes.
2. Copy the below text into an action definition yaml file in this repo, at `.github/workflows/run_tests.yaml`
``` yaml
name: run-tests
on: pull_request
jobs:
  pytest:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r ./api/requirements.txt
      - name: Test with pytest
        run: |
          pytest
```
3. Commit and push the changes
4. Raise a pull request from this branch into main
5. Observe the output. You should notice that the job fails.

Now debug the test locally and fix the code to pass. You can run pytest from within the api folder to run the tests locally: `python3 -m pytest`. You can also view the fronted app to see how the changes manifest themselves.

A file is located at api/example_mongodb.py which should help demonstrate how to aggregate the data.

Once satisfied, you can push the changes and the action should complete successfully. The branch can then be merged.

## Managing vulnerabilities
Dependabot is a useful tool to help manage vulnerable dependencies. It can automatically detect and raise PR's against your codebase when it finds a vulnerability it knows how to fix. To demonstrate this:

1. Under your repository name in GitHub, click Settings
2. In the "Code" section of the sidebar, click "Code security and analysis".
3. Enable "dependabot alerts" and "Dependabot Security Updates"
4. Go to the homepage of your repository. You should see an alert about the findings.
5. Go to "Pull Requests" you should (eventually), see PR's automatically raised to fix issues. If you feel adventurous, approve with caution!


## Pre Commit Hooks
Being able to have tooling hooked into a remote repository which prevents us doing stupid stuff is great, but sometimes it is too late. A good example of this is pushing secrets (such as passwords) to a public repository. Once it's up, the damage it already done.

Pre commit hooks are a very useful way of catching these things early, by blocking commits on you machine until resolved. To try this out:

1. Observe the config in .pre-commit-config.yaml
2. Install the pre-commit package and configure the hooks
``` sh
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```
3. Run `echo "USER=me" > passwords.txt`
4. Commit and push the changes
5. Run `echo "PASSWORD=Pa$$Word" >> passwords.txt`

You should be unable to commit the file until you remove the password from passwords.txt or add it to the baseline secrets.
